# Canyon Run

An early prototype for a game about flying through a canyon. Inspired by that one scene in every action film where the heroes out maneuver their pursuers at high speeds through treacherous terrain. [Try it out!](https://bencreating.github.io/canyon-run/)

The code can be found in [canyon run.p8](https://github.com/BenCreating/canyon-run/blob/main/canyon%20run.p8). I typically put spaces around my operators, but it is more readable in PICO-8's editor without them.

The particle system is modified from a tutorial found in [Dylan Bennett's PICO-8 zine](https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1).

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a tool for making, sharing, and playing tiny games and programs. Designed to emulate the restrictions of a retro gaming console, the limits have been carefully chosen encourage creativity and design.
